  INTRODUCTION

  SECU-3 boot loader is used by SECU-3 and provides functionality for updating
of firmware. Visit main site http://secu-3.org for more information.

  PREREQUISITES

  Here is a list of tools you need to build code and load boot loader into device.

  1. Atmel AVR assembler - avrasm2.exe (Atmel AVR studio includes this one, so 
     you need to install it). Visit http://www.atmel.com for downloading of AVR
     Studio.

  2. hextobin.exe, bintoarray.exe. Download these utils using following link:
     http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/secu3doc/secu-3/utils/prgm_utils.zip

  3. AVReAl - for programming of Atmel AVR microcontrollers by ISP (avreal32.exe)
     or another tool (by your preference). Visit http://real.kiev.ua/avreal/

  Make sure that the PATH variable is set correctly and points to each from these
